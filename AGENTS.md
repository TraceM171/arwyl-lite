# Project AGENTS.md

Agent entry point for this project. Defines the mandatory reads and the consultation contract for the knowledge tree.

## Mandatory reads (auto-loaded on every interaction)

These files are referenced via `@` notation and are auto-sent with every interaction. **Never skip them — read in full before doing anything else.**

- `@knowledge/_basic.md` — project index (subdirectory map, key decisions, philosophy)
- `@knowledge/.local/_basic.md` — owner-specific context (VPS, domain, repo, backup, collab rules)

**Transitive rule:** if any mandatory file above, or any file subsequently opened, explicitly marks another file as "always read" or "mandatory", treat that file as mandatory too and read it before acting. The mandatory set is a closure — follow it at runtime, do not wait to be told. (Example: `knowledge/.local/_basic.md` says "Always read `collab.md`" — so `collab.md` is mandatory by transitivity and must be read on the first turn.)

## Proactive consultation (read as needed)

Beyond the mandatory set, consult the rest of the knowledge tree **before acting, not after**. When a task touches a domain:

1. Open `@knowledge/status.md` first if the task touches the running system — it is the snapshot of what is deployed, in flight, and recently changed. Stale assumptions about the system are the most common mistake.
2. Open the domain's `_basic.md` next (e.g. `knowledge/services/_basic.md`, `knowledge/security/_basic.md`, `knowledge/operations/_basic.md`) — it tells you what the domain contains and the recommended read order inside it.
3. Read the specific model / pattern / audit files in that domain that the task touches.
4. Cross-reference anything linked from the mandatory reads and from any `_basic.md` you open — links are routing hints, not optional.
5. Use `KNOWLEDGE_ORG.md` only when adding, moving, or restructuring knowledge files — not on every interaction.

Do not wait to be asked. If a relevant file exists, open it. The cost of a quick read is lower than the cost of acting on a stale assumption.

## Memory discipline — knowledge system only

**Never use external memory functions to remember things.** This includes the Claude Code memory tool, auto-managed `MEMORY.md` sidecars, or any other tool-level persistence layer. They fragment context, drift from the source of truth, and bypass the org rules.

The knowledge tree (`knowledge/**`, governed by `KNOWLEDGE_ORG.md`) is the single source of truth. Anything worth remembering across sessions — facts, decisions, preferences, conventions, environment quirks, deployment state — goes into the appropriate knowledge file using the five kinds, the per-X convention, and the domain structure. Do not write a sidecar memory file, do not call a memory tool, do not duplicate facts into a tool-managed store. If a memory function offers to record something, write it into the knowledge tree instead and ignore the offer.

## Editing knowledge — `KNOWLEDGE_ORG.md` is mandatory reading first

**Read `KNOWLEDGE_ORG.md` in full before any edit to the knowledge tree.** This is mandatory, not optional. Triggers (any of these means you must read it first):

- Adding a new file
- Moving, renaming, or deleting a file
- Restructuring a domain (split, merge, promote top-level → domain, etc.)
- Changing the kind of a file (e.g. promoting status content into a model)

Why hard: the rules (five kinds, per-X convention, no top-level cruft, no duplication, models contain no state / no history / no recipes) are what keep the tree navigable as it grows. Guessing the rules produces drift, and drift eventually forces a full rewrite. A 5-minute read of `KNOWLEDGE_ORG.md` prevents that.

Quick reminder (still read the full file before editing):

- Files are one of five kinds: **index** / **status** / **model** / **audit** / **pattern**.
- New files go into a domain subdirectory. Do not add top-level files.
- The per-X convention: one file per running service, integration, environment, etc.
- `.local/` is owner-specific. Test: *would a different owner of the same project need this?* If yes, it is not local.
- Model files contain no dates, no state, no history, no recipes — link instead.
- Status lives only in `status.md`. Audits are dated and append-only. Patterns are recipes, not design.
- Link, do not restate. If a fact appears in two files, one of them is wrong.
