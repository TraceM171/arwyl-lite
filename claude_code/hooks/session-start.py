# AGENTS.md is a fixed-size governance doc that doesn't grow with project history — safe to
# inline directly. The three knowledge files are NOT inlined the same way: Claude Code silently
# truncates a large hook additionalContext payload down to a small preview (the same "output too
# large" treatment big tool results get) with no error surfaced anywhere — a growing status.md
# blows past that unnoticed, and the model never sees it while believing context was complete.
# A Read tool call isn't subject to this, so we point the model at the files and let it read them
# itself, rather than gambling on their combined size staying under an undocumented limit.
#
# AGENTS.md itself stays inlined, so it must stay well under the documented 10,000-character hard
# cap on hook additionalContext (code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md). Budget below leaves headroom
# for the read-instruction line appended below and for any other context. This check runs every
# session, so drift can't go unnoticed the way the knowledge-file truncation did.
#
# Raised 8000 -> 8500 in 0.1.14, deliberately: the Decision kind is a permanent sixth entry in the
# taxonomy and its quick-reminder line has to live here.
# Raised 8500 -> 8800 in 0.1.15, deliberately: the "Place for retrieval, not just for kind" rule
# added two permanent pointers here — a read-side one (consultation item 4: follow cross-cutting
# pointers) and a live-capture one — with the full rule kept in KNOWLEDGE_ORG.md, not inlined. The
# only other thing in the payload is the ~150-char read-instruction line below, so the real worst
# case is ~8950 against the 10,000 cap — still ~1k of margin. Keep this in sync with
# AGENTS_MD_BUDGET in .githooks/pre-commit.
